# Security Policy

## Protecting Sensitive Information

This document outlines security practices for working with NovaLink to ensure sensitive information is handled securely.

### Environment Variables

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `.env.example` as a template showing required variables without actual values
- For production, use a secure secrets management solution rather than `.env` files
- Regularly rotate sensitive credentials and API keys

### API Keys and Tokens

- Treat the Replit API key as sensitive information
- Do not hardcode API keys in source code
- Do not log API keys or tokens in application logs
- Set appropriate expiration for tokens

### Database Security

- Use strong, unique passwords for database access
- Limit database user permissions to only what's needed
- Do not expose the database directly to the internet
- Regularly backup database data

### Authentication

- NovaLink uses Replit Authentication by default which provides:
  - Secure user identification
  - Token-based session management
  - Automatic token refresh
- If implementing custom authentication:
  - Use HTTPS for all authentication traffic
  - Implement proper CSRF protection
  - Store passwords using secure hashing algorithms

### Session Management

- Sessions are stored securely in PostgreSQL
- Session cookies are configured with:
  - HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access
  - Secure flag to ensure HTTPS-only transmission
  - Appropriate expiration settings

### Code Security

- Keep dependencies up to date with security patches
- Run security audits regularly: `npm audit`
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive details

### Deployment Security

- Use HTTPS for all production environments
- Configure appropriate Content Security Policy headers
- Enable rate limiting for API endpoints
- Implement proper logging for security events

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in NovaLink:

1. Do not disclose it publicly in issues or discussions
2. Send details privately to the repository maintainers
3. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the vulnerability to be addressed before public disclosure

## Security Features

NovaLink includes several security features:

1. **Input Validation**: All API endpoints validate input data using Zod schemas
2. **Session Protection**: Sessions are protected against theft and fixation
3. **Data Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized before use in database queries
4. **CSRF Protection**: Properly implemented CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

## Security Checklist for Deployment

Before deploying NovaLink to production:

- [ ] Replace default SESSION_SECRET with a strong random value
- [ ] Configure proper HTTPS with valid certificates
- [ ] Set up database user with minimal required permissions
- [ ] Audit npm dependencies for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify all sensitive environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Test authentication flows thoroughly
- [ ] Implement server-side rate limiting
- [ ] Configure proper backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and logging
